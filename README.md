🐍 Python Snake Game (Turtle Graphics)
📘 Overview

This project is part of my Python learning journey, inspired by Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Python Pro Bootcamp.
It focuses on building the classic Snake Game using Python’s built-in turtle module — covering movement logic, collision detection, score tracking, and clean object-oriented design.

Even though this project is simple, it represents the fun and creative side of Python while strengthening core foundations.

🧩 How the Game Works
🟦 Snake Movement

The snake moves continuously on the screen

Arrow keys control direction

Segments follow the head smoothly

🟥 Food Mechanics

Food appears at random coordinates

Every time the snake eats it → length increases + score increments

🟩 Game Rules

Game ends if snake hits a wall

Game ends if snake bites itself

Scoreboard resets at game over

⚙️ Technology Used

Language: Python

Graphics: Turtle Module (built-in)

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

🎯 Project Goals

Strengthen OOP fundamentals

Learn animation using screen updates (tracer, update)

Understand coordinates & motion

Implement basic game logic

Build clean modular Python code

🧠 Learning Notes

This is one of my first hands-on Python projects.
I’m intentionally building each component myself (movement → food → collisions → score) to understand game loops deeply instead of copying full code.

Future improvements will refine the experience further.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Add high score saving (file-based)

Add increasing difficulty

Add sound effects

Add restart menu

Support WASD controls

Wrap-around map mode
