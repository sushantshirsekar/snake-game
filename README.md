# 🐍 Snake Game (Python Turtle)

## 📘 Overview

This project is part of my Python learning journey, inspired by the **Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Pro Bootcamp**.  
It focuses on building the classic **Snake Game** in Python using the **turtle module** — covering game logic, clean code structure, and object-oriented programming.

Even though this is a beginner-friendly game, it demonstrates how to manage game loops, collisions, and class-based architecture.

## 🧩 Project Structure

### 📁 Files Included
- `main.py` — screen setup + game loop  
- `snake.py` — Snake movement, segments, and growth  
- `food.py` — Food generation logic  
- `scoreboard.py` — Score and high-score display

## 🕸️ Game Mechanics

### 🐍 Snake
- Moves smoothly using keyboard controls  
- Grows on eating food  
- Detects self-collision  

### 🍎 Food
- Randomly placed on-screen  
- Respawns instantly after being eaten  

### 🧱 Collisions
- Game over on wall hit  
- Game over on snake body hit
