🐍 Snake Game (Python Turtle)

A classic Snake Game built using Python’s turtle module.
This project is part of my journey through Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Python Pro Bootcamp, where I’m learning fundamentals by creating real projects.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

Control a snake that moves around the screen

Each time it eats food, it grows longer

If it hits the wall or its own tail, the game ends

Score increases as you eat more food

Simple mechanics, fun logic, and a great beginner-friendly project!

🚀 Features

Smooth movement using screen updates

Growing tail mechanic

Collision detection

Score tracking

Clean, modular code (Snake / Food / Scoreboard)

Built with pure Python — no external libraries needed

🧠 What I Learned

Working with Python classes

Managing screen updates with tracer()

Object movement and coordinates

Detecting collisions

Structuring projects across multiple modules

Using the turtle graphics library effectively

▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

Run the game with:

python main.py


No extra packages are required — everything runs with the standard library.

📌 Future Improvements

I may add more enhancements as I continue learning:

High score storage

Increasing speed

Sound effects

Wrap-around mode

Start menu & game restart button
