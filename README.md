🐍 Python Snake Game (Turtle Graphics)
🔷 Overview

This project is part of my Python learning journey, inspired by Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Python Pro Bootcamp.
It focuses on building the classic Snake Game using Python’s built-in turtle module — covering movement logic, collision detection, score tracking, and clean object-oriented design.

Even though this project is simple, it represents the fun and creative side of Python while strengthening core fundamentals.

🧩 How the Game Works
🟩 Snake Movement

The snake moves continuously on the screen

Arrow keys control direction

Segments follow the head smoothly

🍎 Food Mechanics

Food appears at random positions

Eating food increases length

Score increases with each bite

💥 Game Rules

Game ends when snake hits a wall

Game ends if snake bites itself

Scoreboard resets on game over

⚙️ Technology Used

Language: Python

Graphics Library: Turtle (built-in)

Programming Paradigm: OOP

🎯 Project Goals

Strengthen OOP fundamentals

Understand animation loops

Practice using turtle graphics

Implement collisions and movement logic

Learn modular code structure

🧠 Learning Notes

This project helped me understand game design basics, how objects move frame-by-frame, and how to build games using only Python’s standard library.

🔮 Future Enhancements

High score storage

Increasing speed

Sound effects
